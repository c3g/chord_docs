# CHORD Documentation

This repository is for documenting the CHORD project, its formats and services, and its overall goals in a centralized
location. Service-specific documentation that does not pertain to how a service fits into the overall construction of
CHORD should **not** be stored here &mdash; it should be put into the service's individual repository instead.
