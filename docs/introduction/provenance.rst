==================
Project Provenance
==================

Releases are authorized by a committee composed of CHORD and shared platform
software developers and project managers.

Before publication, release candidates *currently* go through the following
validation process:

  * Comprehensive service- and library-level testing suites
  * Testing by hand using synthetic datasets on local machines
  * Advance deployment on select instances that opt into testing newer versions

As part of the release process, documentation is included in the form of tagged
versions of the this website, and service-level ``README`` files for
service-specific technical details.

The developers of the platform are constantly monitoring for the latest patches
to dependencies used in the project. Any updates that are of critical
importance (bug fixes, security flaws) will warrant a patch release of the
software itself, which will pass through the standard release vetting process.
