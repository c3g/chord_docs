What is CHORD?
==============

"CHORD is a project to build a federated, Canadian, national data service for privacy-
sensitive genomic and related health data. It allows the technologies and services being
built by CanDIG [a GA4GH driver project sharing PIs] and its international partners to be
made available to the Canadian health research community more broadly."

Quote from the CHORD SOW; square brackets added for clarity.

In more technical terms, CHORD is a set of microservices that allow the sharing, management, and discovery of genomic
and health data across a federated network. CHORD heavily benefits from and utilizes GA4GH's efforts to create standard
APIs and formats for genomic and health data transfer and storage.
