===========================
Adding Data to the Drop Box
===========================

Currently, no upload mechanism is available for CHORD. Files should be copied
via some out-of-band mechanism to the CHORD node and placed in whichever folder
is bound to ``/chord/data/drop-box`` inside the container. These files and
folders will appear in the front end's "Files" section.
